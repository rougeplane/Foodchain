# Foodchain
Creates a decentralized marketplace
huge help was taken from https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46
the code somewhat works but the changes we  made renered it unsuable.
so we reverted it back to the form in which it worked 
The idea was to make a decentralized PDC which would take x amount of money and deliver food. 
IT basically was supposed to work by letting a seller put up an item on the blockchain and then a buyer would buy it for a certain amount of money which would be given to PDC then when a miner would mine the block PDC would give back the seller his money and the miner and PDC would take a certain fee. 
WE were begginers the code didnt work as we intended and took a lot of "help" from https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46 but it was a great experience and hope that next year we can perform a lot better.
